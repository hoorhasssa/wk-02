                <h1>About Nadia Gundert</h1>
                <p>Welcome! I’m Nadia Gundert: wife, mom of 3 and a proud Kingstonian. I love Kingston and am delighted to call it home. It is an amazing place to live and work, with small town charm and big city perks! I have a passion for service and building relationships with others and am so excited to be turning my focus toward real estate. I am ready to help with your home buying and selling needs. As a proud member of the RE/MAX Hallmark® family, I carry the values of hard work, integrity, and outstanding client service into everything I do. You might also recognize me from my side-hustle and creative outlet Sweet Treats by Nadia where I bake and custom decorate cookies for the wonderful people of Kingston and area. So, let’s find your home sweet home! I would love to help you find a property that fits with what you’re looking for or sell a property as you move on to your next adventure in life. I’ll walk with you every step of the way and look forward to getting to know you. Let’s connect!</p>
